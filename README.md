Overview
This project is a Job Recommendation System that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze job descriptions, extract key features, and recommend relevant jobs based on similarity measures. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and similarity analysis to help users find the most relevant job postings.

The job descriptions undergo cleaning and tokenization:

• Lowercasing all text.
• Removing special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces using regex.
• Tokenizing words using nltk.word_tokenize().
• Filtering stop words (common words that don’t add meaning, like "the" or "and").
• The "Job Title" field is also processed by:
• Splitting multi-word titles into separate tokens.
• Standardizing text by removing capitalization and spaces.

Use Cases:

• Job seekers can find similar job postings based on a given job title.
• HR & Recruiters can categorize job listings and analyze job market trends.
• Companies can use clustering to identify skill gaps and refine job descriptions.

This project applies NLP, clustering, and similarity analysis to build an intelligent job recommendation system. It provides automated job matching by analyzing job descriptions and computing their similarity, helping users find the most relevant job postings efficiently.
